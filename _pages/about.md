Hello

I am a PhD student in the Department of Political Science at University of California, Berkeley. My research interests include conflict, political violence, authoritarian politics, and survey methodology. My ongoing research examines perceptions of protest violence. My work has been published in the _International Journal of Public Opinion Research_ and _Japanese Journal of Political Science_. 

I hold an MPhil in International Relations from University of Oxford and a BSocSc in Politics from University of Hong Kong. I am an organizing member of the [Global Research Association of Politics in Hong Kong (GRAPH)](http://graph-hk.github.io/web).

Please feel free to get in touch via email at [polly.chan@berkeley.edu](mailto:polly.chan@berkeley.edu?).
