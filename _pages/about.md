I am a PhD student in the Department of Political Science at University of California, Berkeley. My research interests include conflict, political violence, authoritarian politics, and survey methodology. My ongoing research examines perceptions towards and support for violent conflict actors. My work has been published or is forthcoming in the _Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties_, _International Journal of Public Opinion Research_ and _Japanese Journal of Political Science_. 

I hold an MA in Political Science from Berkeley, an MPhil in International Relations from University of Oxford, and a BSocSc in Politics from University of Hong Kong. I am an organizing member of the [Global Research Association of Politics in Hong Kong (GRAPH)](http://graph-hk.github.io/web). Prior to my postgraduate studies, I was a freelance journalist and worked with The Economist, Novaya Gazeta, DIE ZEIT, Vice News, Berlingske, Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen (SRF), and Le MÃ©dia.
